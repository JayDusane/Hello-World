   <p>Today’s market needs experience but, that does not quite work for newbies. So, here we are to present TendWe. Our aim is to provide an opportunity to every individual, where users can work with any companies on their freelance projects</p>
   <p>It’s social media platform, we ask users to create a profile on TendWe. Once the user creates a profile, he can start with surfing through multinational companies where he can find numerous projects uploaded by the organization. In that project summary companies put every single detail on how they want to execute their project, what are the requirements etc., when users click on the project, they will ask to put their details such as Aadhar card/ passport details. Mobile number, name, date of birth. After they fill details users can pick the project and start working, once they done with the project, they have sent it back to the company via TendWe. And the reputed organization will review the project if their project fulfills companies' need then the company will give a rating to the Users profile. Based on that rating TendWe will calculate and give an overall score which we are going to name (TendWe score).</p>
   <p>As many projects you do and if the company accept your work, TendWe will give you Experience/Accommodation letter. Which will be provided by you via a company with a respected owner or CEO’s signature. So, you can put that on your resume as a reference. There will one other thing which is the rating. When they came across a situation where they have to invest money to complete the project. So, every time the company gives you rating TendWe will pay you as appreciation.  (5 to 6k as a stipend).</p>

Thus, we aim to provide a great opportunity for all students from all over the world to showcase their capabilities to direct companies before they get paid.</p>

   <p><b>ROI Plan</b></p>
   <p>Once we are live on the web, we start approaching companies for their involvement. Projects will attract users. And once we gain sufficient user and traffic, we start membership plans where the company has to buy a monthly package. They have to let us know how many projects they are going to post and their deadline. As an example, "The company make their profile on TendWe. And if they are planning to post-project then they click on the project tab and then click on post projects. Where they have to put project quantity on monthly basis, project description, deadline, requirement, etc. and based on that we are going to charge them between 2k to 5k (based on country) on per project. If they do not get a complete project back then we will give a refund. 

   <p>2nd Important ROI thing is a User. As we are going to provide them big stipend and experience latter as well. But for all of this benefits they have to buy our membership plan. Which we are going to charge between 1000 to 1500 INR.</p>
